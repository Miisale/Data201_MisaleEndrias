## And My Favorite Quotes Include:

## My Favorite Shows in Code Formatting

In Data and programming classes, I can store my favorite shows in a vector or list using `c()` in R or `[]` in python.

```
shows <- c("The Vampire Diaries", "The Office", "SpongeBob")
shows = ["The Vampire Diaries", "The Office", "SpongeBob"]
```
